# CleanCity

## Intro:
The main goal of this project is to manage the waste collection system and minimize pollution. 
By making use of sensors, we collect data from the garbage bins and send them to a gateway using the Wi-Fi system of the dustbin. The data from various garbage bins are collected by the gateway and sent to the cloud over the Internet. In the proposed system, garbage bins equipped with low-cost embedded devices are located at various places in the entire city. The real-time status of the garbage level and garbage bin location is sent to the Firebase. We have designed a mobile applications for waste collection drivers and Municipal Corporations to monitor and control solid waste collection as a service. Mobile application facilitates the waste collection drivers to go to the garbage bins using dynamic and shortest routes.
